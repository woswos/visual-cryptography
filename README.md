# visual-cryptography
Multi-image encryption using multiple shares and its possible applications to kinetic installations

This project has two main parts: the python script for doing the visual encryption magic and a website to use the script.
The [website part](https://github.com/woswos/visual-cryptography/tree/master/laravel) is under development, but you can find the visual encryption script in the [python folder](https://github.com/woswos/visual-cryptography/tree/master/python).
